== Description ==

**Pirate Forms is no longer under active development. We recommend using <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpforms-lite/" rel="friend">WPForms</a> because it is the most beginner-friendly WordPress contact form plugin in the market.**

In Sep 2018, <a href="https://wpforms.com/wpforms-has-acquired-pirate-forms/" rel="friend">Pirate Forms was acquired by WPForms</a>. We're retiring Pirate Forms in favor of the modern form builder by WPForms, so users can have access to best user experience and more powerful WordPress form features.

Stay in touch with your visitors very easily. Pirate Contact Forms offers you a great and friendly contact form for your website.

**Why use our responsive WordPress Contact Form:**

- It's easy to use

This Contact Form 7 or any form builder alternative is very easy to set up. You can quickly create an engaging contact form by using a shortcode and copying it where you want it to appear.

- It's fully customizable

This WordPress Contact Form plugin allows you to customize everything you want. You can change the field labels and decide what message to tell your visitors when an error shows up. You can also decide which fields are required and which are not.

- Provides reCaptcha

Avoid spam messages and make sure the e-mails you receive are entirely addressed to you.

- Comes with SMTP

Pirate Form comes with basic SMTP options, so you won't miss any email from your visitors. The messages will be safely delivered from the source to your personal e-mail address.

However for a more reliable SMTP solution, we recommend using <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/">WP Mail SMTP by WPForms</a> which is the most popular WordPress SMTP solution being used by over 1 million websites.

- Stores contacts in special databases

You can keep all the contacts in an archive by saving their e-mail addresses. Pirate Contact Form allows you to do that by providing contact databases.

A simple to use contact form plugin for creating a clean contact form using the [pirate_forms] shortcode or the 'Pirate Forms' form widget.

- Provides option to allow submitting the form using AJAX

Standard contact forms work just fine, but you can make them nicer by using AJAX to submit the form data in the background.

Pirate Forms allows you to take advantage of this great feature using the [pirate_forms ajax="yes"] shortcode or the 'Submit form using Ajax' option in the Pirate Forms widget.

- What PirateForms isn't for now

This is not a form maker or drag & drop builder plugin nor "the best contact form plugin". You cannot add new fields or create multiple forms (subscription forms, payment, order, feedback or quote) with Pirate Forms.

This is why we recommend using <a href="https://wpforms.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=pirateformslite" rel="friend" title="WPForms">WPForms</a> which is the most beginner friendly drag & drop WordPress form builder in the market.

**Pirate Forms is no longer under active development**

Pirate Forms is no longer under active development. We recommend using <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpforms-lite/" rel="friend">WPForms</a> because it is the most beginner-friendly WordPress contact form plugin in the market.

In Sep 2018, <a href="https://wpforms.com/wpforms-has-acquired-pirate-forms/" rel="friend">Pirate Forms was acquired by WPForms</a>. We're retiring Pirate Forms in favor of the moden form builder by WPForms, so users can have access to best user experience and more powerful WordPress form features.

Also, I'm the founder of <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/" rel="friend">WPBeginner</a>, the largest WordPress resource site for beginners. It was a huge priority for me to make a WordPress contact form plugin that beginners can use without any training.

I feel that we have done that here. I hope you enjoy using WPForms.
